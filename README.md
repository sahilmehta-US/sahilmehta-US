**Hi, I'm Sahil Mehta** ðŸ‘‹

Previously, I worked in building LLMs and creating Machine Learning structures in various languages (e.g. C)

Currently, I'm working on 

* [CTorch](https://url-to-github-page.com), a fully C-based emulation of the popular PyTorch Python library, specifically focused currently on tensor and neural network applications.
* [NumC](https://url-to-github-page.com), a fully C-based emulation of the popular NumPy Python Library, focused on fast N-dimensional array operations

Previously, I've worked on
* [CalCorridors](https://github.com/sahilmehta-US/CalCorridors/tree/main), a study on the effects of wildfires on California Terrestrial Habitat Connectivity under UC Davis ([Publication](https://agu.confex.com/agu/fm23/meetingapp.cgi/Paper/1432570)).
* [Prunus-in-Bialowieza](https://github.com/sahilmehta-US/Prunus-in-Bialowieza), an examination of the impacts of introduction-stage invasive _Prunus Domestica_ expansion in Old Growth BiaÅ‚owieza Forest under the University of Warsaw, Poland.
* [Cynamic_Integers](https://github.com/sahilmehta-US/Cynamic_Integers), a fully C-based emulation of the dynamic-sized integers often featured in popular programming languages such as Python. This project introduces a new structure, dynamic_int, that prevents overflow errors while maintaining many of the useful functionalities provided in C.
